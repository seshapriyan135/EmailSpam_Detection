# Email Spam Detection


## Overview

This project implements an email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The model classifies emails as either spam or not spam (ham) based on their content.

## Features
    * Preprocessing of email text data
    * Feature extraction using TF-IDF
    * Classification using machine learning algorithms
    * Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

## Installation
Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/seshapriyan135/EmailSpam_Detection.git
    cd EmailSpam_Detection
Install dependencies:
    
     pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:
    
    jupyter notebook

## Usage

    *Load the dataset and preprocess the text.
    *Train the model using a chosen machine learning algorithm.
    *Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on test data.
    *Use the trained model to classify new email messages.
